    <h1>please work?</h1>
    <p>sooo, i'm not sure about how i'm supposed to make this work. is git it's own computer language?</p>
   
   <h2>Ok I found some interesting info!!!</h2>
    <p>As i understood it, to create a site out of this file, I'd have to create a repository or <br>
    something. Ok, maybe not create one, cause I've got this one, but put it somewhere. </p>
    
    <h3>Here's a link to some instructions!</h3>
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">right here S2</a>
    <p>for now though, I think I'll keep just using the "code box" from khan academy exercises.</p>
    <p>ok i tried but i don't think it worked?</p>
    
    <h4>anyway... I think i'll leave this alone for now.</h4>
    <h5>THIS IS FUN!!</h5>
    <p>Okay... the site is up and running!!</p>
    <p>I'll see if the changes appear on the site after I save them here and refresh the page.</p>
    
    <h2>The changes came after around 2-3 mins after saving them here</h2>
    <p>the rgb color didn't work... hmmm</p>
    
    <h3>RGB MIGHT NOT WORK BUT RGBA DOES<br> YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH</h3>
    <p>hmmmmmm... I wanna put an image here.</p>
